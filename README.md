# Simple Bipedal Robot

This project is a biped robot. The project will use 2 servos for the legs of the robot (3 on each leg). The ardunio on the robot is connected to the computer for a power supply. The robot will be able to walk forward.

# Materials for project (with cost of each material)

1 x Arduino Uno ($25) <br />
1 x Breadboard ($4)<br />
Craft (popsicle) sticks ($3) <br />
2 x ¾” metal brackets (2$) <br />
4 x micro servos 9g (12$) <br />
Hot glue gun (10$) <br />
Glue sticks for glue gun (4$) <br />
Tape (3$) <br />
Wires (2$) <br />
Breakaway headers (2$) <br />

# Breadboard Diagram
This is a breadboard diagram of how to set up the servos to the arduino. Each servo will have three wires that are connected to the arduino.

Power: The power wire will connect to the 5V power of the arduino which is typically a red wire.<br />
Ground: The ground wire will connect to the Ground of the arduino which is typically a black or brown wire.<br />
Signal (Pulse): The signal wire connects to an arduino digital pin. The wire colour is typically yellow or orange.

# Usage 
Once you have built the robot the code will need to be uploaded to the Arduino. To upload it the file go to the build folder located above and copy the code to the Arduino software. Once the code is in the Arduino software you can upload it to the Arduino Uno on the robot.
