# CS207 Project Biped Robot

This project is a biped robot. The project will use 2 servos for the legs of the robot (3 on each leg). The ardunio on the robot is connected to the computer for a power supply. The robot will be able to walk forward.

# Materials for project

1 x Arduino Uno <br />
1 x Breadboard <br />
Craft (popsicle) sticks <br />
2 x ¾” metal brackets <br />
4 x micro servos 9g <br />
Hot glue gun <br />
Glue <br />
Stick tape <br />
Wires <br />
Breakaway headers <br />

# Breadboard Diagram
This is a breadboard diagram of how to set up the servos to the arduino. Each servo will have three wires that are connected to the arduino.

Power: The power wire will connect to the 5V power of the arduino which is typically a red wire.<br />
Ground: The ground wire will connect to the Ground of the arduino which is typically a black or brown wire.<br />
Signal (Pulse): The signal wire connects to an arduino digital pin. The wire colour is typically yellow or orange.
