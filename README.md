# CS207 Project 

This project is a biped robot. The project will use 6 servos for the legs of the robot (3 on each leg). The robot will be controlled using the keyboard from the computer. The ardunio on the robot is connected to the computer for both power and for reading control inputs for the robot. The robot will have multiple functions such as walking and various others (yet to be detrmined).
