# CS207 Project 

This project is a biped robot. The project will use 6 servos for the legs of the robot (3 on each leg). The robot will be controlled using the keyboard from the computer. The ardunio on the robot is connected to the computer for both power and for reading control inputs for the robot. The robot will have multiple functions such as walking and various others (yet to be detrmined).


This is a breadboard diagram of how to set up the servos to the arduino. Each servo will have three wires that are connected to the arduino.

Power: The power wire will connect to the 5V power of the arduino which is typically a red wire.<br />
Ground: The ground wire will connect to the Ground of the arduino which is typically a black or brown wire.
Signal (Pulse): The signal wire connects to an arduino digital pin. The wire colour is typically yellow or orange.
